                This semester, we are bringing you the nostalgic joys of retro
                arcade games. Invite your professor, TA, RA/PL, or mentor to
                lunch and get to know them better over a few rounds of Street
                Fighter, or perhaps you would rather work together to save
                Princess Peach from Bowser. You get lunch and unlimited plays at
                our 3 arcade game machines.
