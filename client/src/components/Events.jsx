                            This semester, we are bringing you the nostalgic joys of retro arcade 
                            games. Invite your professor, TA, RA/PL, or mentor to lunch and get to 
                            know them better over a few rounds of Street Fighter, or perhaps you 
                            would rather work together to save Princess Peach from Bowser.
                            You get lunch and unlimited plays at our 3 arcade game machines.
